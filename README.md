# Forkify
Built as part of coursework going over vanilla javascript, course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)

Make sure to check out my [Hosted Demo](forkify.site)

## Features
* paginated API calls to [Food 2 Fork](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/food2fork)
* manipulate ingredients per serving
* shopping list creation
* recipe favoriting

# Drawbacks

The original API has been deprecated, among other issues. As of 8/6/2020 The hosted demo is still operational, with limited API support. Stick to searching within the 5 main food groups... steak, chicken, pizza, pie, and brocolli of course... A few other searches work but it is only a demonstration project after all.
